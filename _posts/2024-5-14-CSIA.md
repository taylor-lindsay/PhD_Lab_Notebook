Round 6 had p-buffer contamination so I re-prepped all the samples. 

1.  Weighed out fish (3mg) and host samples (8mg)
2.  Acid hydrolysis: 20 hours, filtered
3.  Derivatization: TFAA + DCM
4.  P-buffer: Chloroform & p-buffer
5.  derivatization: TFAA + DCM
6.  Prepped cuts: 250uL, blowdown, +ethyl acetate, small vials 

Other Lab Prep: 

- Made new p-buffer solution using sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate
- Prepped glassware for muffling
- Processed Round 8 GC results
